# BernieSandersGreetingCard
This was my first major python graphics project. I got lost in python code for about 17 straight hours, starting on a Friday afternoon and finishing the following Saturday. This is what happens when you teach a portrait artist how to code. One file. Many polygons. A rainbow of skin tones.  Enjoy!
