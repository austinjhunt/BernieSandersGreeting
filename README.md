# BernieSandersGreetingCard
This was my first major python graphics project. I got lost in python code for about 17 straight hours, starting on a Friday afternoon and finishing the following Saturday. This is what happens when you teach a portrait artist how to code. One file. Many polygons. A rainbow of skin tones.  Enjoy! 

## How to use:

1) open terminal

2)clone the repository

3)navigate to the BernieSandersGreetingCard directory ('cd BernieSandersGreetingCard')

4)use the command 'python valentineGreeting.py' to execute the file!
